<!-- The name drposter came from a convoluted pun: it's a poster based on R, M.D. files (not a real doctor),
and it also generates academic posters for PhD's and others. -->


# {.col-2 style="grid-row: span 4;"}
<!-- Span the first column for four rows, that way we can capture the usage block, two rows of template examples, and refs/footer information -->

## Overview

* Template for writing HTML/CSS posters using Rmarkdown
* Same conventions as pandoc presentations (e.g. reveal.js)[@revealjs; @rstudio-reveal; @mdformats]
* Separates content from presentation
* Goal: automatically get consistent spacing from specifications instead of a manual layout

## Rmarkdown structure

<div class="fullwidth">See also the [source code](https://github.com/bbucior/drposter/tree/master/inst/example/poster.Rmd) and [compiled pdf](https://github.com/bbucior/drposter/tree/master/inst/example/poster.pdf) for this poster on Github.</div>

# {.col-3}
## Overall document columns (`<h1>`)

Content is organized using headers as sections.  Level 1
sections define the overall layout of subblocks.  Use the
`.col-x` class to use x columns for subblocks.

## Another left column block

You can place multiple subblocks within the same overall
.col-x, for example to get a 3-column layout like this
example code here.

# {.col-3}
## Individual content blocks (`<h2>`)

Actual content goes within the level 2 blocks, which have
two inner columns by default, e.g. for figures.

![](path_to_figure.jpg)

Most of the markdown commands seem to work, though there
are probably still some that are untested.

# {.col-3}
## Use this div to write your references in a section:

<div id="refs" class="references"></div>

```

## How to use this package

### Installation and updates {.fullwidth}

1. `devtools::install_github("bbucior/drposter", dep=FALSE)` (or `install_local` on a downloaded copy) to install/update the package
2. In RStudio, you can find the format listed as a template under the "New R Markdown" wizard, or use the command line.
3. Template files are cached in `drposter_files/` to decouple your poster from the installed package version.  Use `drposter_update` to resync them.

### Customizing the template

* Avoid modifying `drposter_files/`
* Indirectly override those rules in your own `custom.css` or equivalent
  * Easier to see and share your changes
  * Decouples your modifications from the base drposter styles
* Customize the format of the bibliography[@rstudio-bib;@stackoverflow-refs] using a CSL style[@csl-github]

### Export

* View and "print as PDF" from Chrome[@firefox-footnote]  <!-- Note: the footnote used to be a bibtex "note," but the default ACS template doesn't include that field -->
* Be sure to save a PDF (and possibly html with `self_contained: true`) to archive your project at the end, in case there are changes in pandoc, rmarkdown, etc.
* You can also render the poster in other formats, such as `github_document` or `revealjs::revealjs_presentation`


## Reproducible research

### Directly include plots

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

### Directly include stats

```{r cars_demo}
summary(cars)
```



# {.col-2}

## Customizable themes

Note the features for theming.  If you had a special class attached to the .level1 or .slides/theme, you could use a general descendent selector to automatically get theming support, then break up these details into separate theme files.

# {.col-4}

## Default theme

This is an example of the default theme.

# {.col-4 .theme-minimalist}

## Minimalist theme

This is an example of the minimalist theme.
